BUG REPORT for TEST CASE 1

March 24, 2023

Description:
    'Wins:' and 'Loses:' count does not add correctly. Both wins and 
    losses are added to the 'Losses:' count.

Steps to reproduce:
    1. To start a duel, visit the website http://localhost:4000/ 

    2. Click the 'Draw' button on the landing page.

    3. Select the two robots with the highest health and click 'Add to Duo'.

    4. Once the two robots have been selected, scroll down and click the 'Duel!' 
       button to start a match.

    5. Your selected two robots are compared against the computer's two robots.
       If you didn't win, follow step 1-4 until you see the message 'You won!'

    6. The 'Wins:' count should increment however, the wins are added and counted
       in "Losses:'

Expected Result:
    - When the message 'You Won!' is displayed, the count for 'Wins:' should 
      increase by one.

Actual Result:
    - When the message 'You Won!' displays, the count is added to 'Losses:' and
      that increases by one.

Environment:
    - Google Chrome Version 111.0.5563.64 (Official Build) (arm64)
